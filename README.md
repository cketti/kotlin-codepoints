# kotlin-codepoints

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) library that adds basic support for Unicode code points. 

**Note:** This library is a side project and work in progress. When evaluating whether to use this in production, please
consider this project unmaintained. That being said, contributions are welcome. But don't expect fast responses.

## Installation
kotlin-codepoints is distributed through Maven Central.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Basic API
    implementation("de.cketti.unicode:kotlin-codepoints:0.10.0")

    // or
    
    // Nice API
    implementation("de.cketti.unicode:kotlin-codepoints-deluxe:0.10.0")
}
```

## Features

### kotlin-codepoints

This library aims to make some methods of the Java standard library available to Kotlin multiplatform projects.

Methods found in `java.lang.String`:
* `CharSequence.codePointAt(index)`
* `CharSequence.codePointBefore(index)`
* `CharSequence.codePointCount(beginIndex, endIndex)`
* `CharSequence.offsetByCodePoints(index, codePointOffset)`

Methods found in `java.lang.StringBuilder`:
* `Appendable.appendCodePoint(codePoint)`

Methods found in `java.lang.Character`: 
* `CodePoints.isValidCodePoint(codePoint)`
* `CodePoints.isBmpCodePoint(codePoint)`
* `CodePoints.isSupplementaryCodePoint(codePoint)`
* `CodePoints.charCount(codePoint)`
* `CodePoints.isSurrogatePair(highSurrogate, lowSurrogate)`
* `CodePoints.highSurrogate(codePoint)`
* `CodePoints.lowSurrogate(codePoint)`
* `CodePoints.toCodePoint(highSurrogate, lowSurrogate)`
* `CodePoints.toChars(codePoint)`
* `CodePoints.toChars(codePoint, destination, offset)`

On the JVM the platform implementation (`java.lang.Character.*`) is used. On all other platforms the 
[implementation in this library](src/commonImplementation/kotlin) is used.

### kotlin-codepoints-deluxe

This library builds on top of `kotlin-codepoints`. It adds a the `CodePoint` class to make working with code points a 
bit less painful.

Until someone gets around to building and publishing proper documentation, 
see [CodePoint.kt](https://github.com/cketti/kotlin-codepoints/blob/main/kotlin-codepoints-deluxe/src/commonMain/kotlin/CodePoint.kt)
to get and idea of what's available.

#### Example:
```kotlin
val text = "ðŸ¦•&ðŸ¦–"

for (codePoint in text.codePointSequence()) {
    print("code point: ${codePoint.toUnicodeNotation()}, char count: ${codePoint.charCount}")

    if (codePoint.isBasic) {
        println(" - boring!")
    } else {
        println()
    }
}

// Output:
// -------
// code point: U+1F995, char count: 2
// code point: U+0026, char count: 1 - boring!
// code point: U+1F996, char count: 2
```
